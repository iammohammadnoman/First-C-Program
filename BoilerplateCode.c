/*Boilerplate code in C programming refers to a standard template of code 
that serves as a starting point for writing new programs. It typically includes
the necessary headers, main function, and sometimes basic structure for handling 
input and output. Here is an example of boilerplate code for a simple C program: */

#include <stdio.h>  // Include the standard input-output header

int main() {
    // Main function - starting point of the program
    printf("Hello, World!\n");  // Print a message to the console

    return 0;  // Indicate that the program ended successfully
}
//? Explanation:
//* 1. '#include <stdio.h>' : This line includes the standard input-output library which is necessary for using printf and other standard I/O functions.
//* 2. 'int main() { ... }' : This defines the main function where the execution of the program begins.
//* 3. 'printf("Hello, World!\n");' : This prints "Hello, World!" followed by a new line to the console.
//* 4. 'return 0;' : This statement indicates that the program has finished successfully. In C, returning 0 from main typically means the program executed without errors.

//*** This boilerplate code can be modified and expanded to create more complex programs.
