}
//* #include <stdio.h> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output functions, such as printf() (used in line 4). Header files add functionality to C programs.
//* C ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.
//* Another thing that always appear in a C program is main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed. Also, programme execution has started from main functions.
//* printf() displays the string inside quotation. printf() is a library function used to output/print text to the screen.
//* return 0 ends the main() function.
//* Here I can also use getchar() instead of return 0. getchar command will help removing unnecessery line in outputs.
//! Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket } to actually end the main function.
